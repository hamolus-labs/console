## Deploy to Cloudflare

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hamolus-labs/console)

That button forks this repository into your own GitHub account, names the Worker,
provisions the KV namespace, D1 database and R2 bucket on your account, and wires
up Workers Builds so later pushes deploy themselves.

The console is static assets only, so it needs no secrets. It reads whatever core
you give it at runtime — point it at the Worker you just deployed.
<!-- deploy:end -->

The Hamolus console: a SolidJS + StyleX admin app for collections, records, media,
files, panels, users and multi-land scope. It is also the source that
`hamolus add console` copies into a project.

## Use it

```bash
hamolus add console        # copy this app into ./console
```

In a generated project the console is a workspace member you can edit freely — the
`add` command copies the source, it does not import this package at runtime.

## What it does

- **Collections** — edit a collection's definition (fields, flags, labels, groups) in
  a form or as raw JSON; the core creates and migrates the physical table.
- **Records** — generic table with search, filters, sorting, grouping, column
  persistence, and forms generated from the field definitions (relations, media,
  files, rich text, localized values).
- **Media / Documents / Attachments** — R2-backed libraries with taxonomy, cropping,
  focus points and variants.
- **Panels** — manifests, roles and members; the panel definition viewer.
- **Lands** — tenant registry, colonies and platform super-admins.
- **Settings** — the KV settings blob, plus self-service password changes.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev                              # http://localhost:5173
CORE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787 pnpm dev
```

The console proxies `/api` to the core in development, so the browser talks to one
origin. It is deployed as Worker static assets with
`not_found_handling: "single-page-application"`.

## What's new

An **MCP exposure** section in the collection editor, so a collection's agent
visibility is set where the collection is declared.
